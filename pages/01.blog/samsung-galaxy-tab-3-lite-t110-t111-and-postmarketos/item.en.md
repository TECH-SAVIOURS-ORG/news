I check out my old devices (laptops, phones...) from time to time to use them as a server, to give them away, or if they've really reached the end for good, they might find peace at the dump. But most of the time they actually find their way back into the drawer.
This time I found an old tab in my drawer. A Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite T110. I searched for something great for the device, a lineage rom or something else. It turned out to be something else. But not just another custom rom, no, it was postmarketos! 
What am I supposed to do with that? I'm not sure, the fact that postmarketos is running on it is great. I'll probably just install a browser (homeassistant) to check the security cameras and put it on the wall. Or another DNS backup? Probably not. Not sure yet. We'll see. The options are now different for this device than "just" Android.

If you also have the t110 or t111, just check https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_3_Lite_7.0_(samsung-goyawifi) . The link to XDA is also there. 

Have fun.
