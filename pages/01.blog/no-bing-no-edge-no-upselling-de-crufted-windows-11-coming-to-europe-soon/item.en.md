Some changes will arrive for non-EU users, too, but not the easy removals.

Using Windows these days means putting up with many, many pitches to use and purchase other Microsoft products. Some are subtle, like the built-in Edge browser suggesting you use its "recommended settings" after each major update. Some are not so subtle, like testing a "quiz" that made some users explain why they're trying to quit the OneDrive app.

Those living in the European Economic Area (EEA)—which includes the EU and adds Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway—will soon get the volume turned down on their Windows 11 systems. To meet the demands of the European Commission's Digital Markets Act—slated to be enforced in March 2024—Microsoft must make its apps easier to uninstall, its default settings easier to change, and its attempts at steering people toward its services easier to avoid.

Microsoft writes in a blog post that many of these changes will be available in a preview update of Windows 11 (version 23H2) this month. Windows 10 will get similar changes "at a later date." A couple of changes affect all Windows 10 and 11 users:

    Apps that are critical to Windows will be labeled with a "System" tag in Settings, the Start menu, and search results
    Camera, Cortana, and Photos can now be uninstalled

In the EEA, much more is on the way:

    Bing's web search from the Start menu and the Edge browser can be uninstalled
    Third parties can add to the Windows Widgets Board feeds
    Third parties, like Google or DuckDuckGo, can provide the built-in web search results that Bing once had exclusively
    Windows users who choose to sync their Microsoft accounts will have their pinned apps and preferences synced, seemingly keeping their EEA-enabled choices
    Windows will now "always use customers' configured app default settings for link and file types"
