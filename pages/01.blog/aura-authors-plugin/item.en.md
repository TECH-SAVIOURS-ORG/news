We've changed the [original-plugin](https://github.com/matt-j-m/grav-plugin-aura-authors) a little to our needs. It's a quick solution but easy to change if you need to. So if you're using GRAV as your Blog or News feed and looking for an author plugin for multilingual as well so that you can have multi-authors for multilingual you can have a look at [github.com/TECH-SAVIOURS-ORG](https://github.com/TECH-SAVIOURS-ORG/grav-plugin-aura-authors).  
The code is hardcode atm we might change it in the future if we need to.
