We're very excited to announce the release 8.1 of Proxmox Virtual Environment! It's based on Debian 12.2 "Bookworm" but uses a newer Linux kernel 6.5, QEMU 8.1.2, and OpenZFS 2.2.0 ((with stable fixes backported)

Here is a selection of the highlights of Proxmox VE 8.1

    Debian 12.2 (“Bookworm”), but uses a newer Linux kernel 6.5 as stable default
    latest versions of QEMU 8.1.2 and ZFS 2.2.0 including the most important bugfixes from 2.2.1 already
    Software-defined Networking (SDN)
    Secure Boot
    New flexible notification system with matcher-based approach
    Ceph Server: Ceph Reef 18.2.0 is default, and Ceph Quincy 17.2.7 comes with continued support.
    Countless GUI and API improvements.

As always, we have included countless bugfixes and improvements on many places; see the release notes for all details.
