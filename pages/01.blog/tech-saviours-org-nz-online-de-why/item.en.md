# Hierarchy of TECH SAVIOURS

1. [techsaviours.org](https://techsaviours.org)
2. [techsaviours.online](https://techsaviours.online)
3. [techsaviours.nz](https://techsaviours.nz)
4. [tech-saviours.de](https://tech-saviours.de)

Well, actually only .ORG is something like at the first place. You can choose whatever is important for you.  
This can be confusing for some, but there is a valid reason for all of this. If we would choose only one domain, which one would it be? .ORG or .ONLINE? We described it below.

# Community - _.ORG_
Sharing is caring is a phrase that is very important. Without sharing of knowledge and services, it would not really be possible to achieve an adequate data privacy goal. Reaching an open world for everyone, it needs open codes, trust and more options to choose from.  
So we want to give you the opportunity to set up your own server and use other online services not called Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, ... . 
There are other services/software/companies that won't collect your personal data and we can show you a way that you may not even have known that it exists.  
TECH **SAVIOURS** _.ORG_ is another part of many different privacy communities out there. So your options are getting just bigger and bigger. 

# Local Support - _.NZ_ & _.DE_
We wanted to have specific domains for our local support, which are located in New Zealand and Germany. For proper marketing/advertising we wanted to have trusted domains for the specific countries - .DE & .NZ.  
Having everything under one domain can create conflicts. Which is not only the language. So we keep everything separate to keep our local information for the specific countries/domain only.  

# Rest of the world - _.ONLINE_
If you live in a country not listed under [local support](#local-support-nz-de) and don't have the [time or knowledge](#community-org) to create your own server, we can help you with that, but only online.  
Another reason is that advertising in other countries with .DE or .NZ is untrustworthy and confusing.  
  
I hope this helps a little to understand how TECH **SAVIOURS** is structured. If you still have questions, just send us an email.
