Hey

After a little break, we are now continuing to work on our wiki and finished our BorgBackup guide.

We have also added a new status page for our services via Uptime Kuma.

https://wiki.techsaviours.org/en/server/services/borg
https://status.techsaviours.org/status/org

German guide will follow as usual.

Have a good week
Dan
