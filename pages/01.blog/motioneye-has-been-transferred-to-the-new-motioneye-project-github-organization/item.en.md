Just seen that motioneye got a new dev team. Probably for one or the other well known people behind the dev team. Thats great news! 

"Due to personal reasons [Calin Crisan](https://github.com/ccrisan) can no longer be actively involved with this project. It has been transferred to the new [motioneye-project](https://github.com/motioneye-project) GitHub organization with a new [developer team](https://github.com/orgs/motioneye-project/people). Please check out the [dev](https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneye/tree/dev) branch for current development, which includes:"

Thank you for keeping this project alive!

Since the project wasn't really maintained anymore, I tried also [ZoneMinder](https://zoneminder.com/), but I didn't have enough time yet. I'm looking forward to that as well.
