# WireGuard tutorial and our wiki

Two days ago I added a [WireGuard tutorial](https://wiki.techsaviours.org/en/server/services/wireguard) to [our wiki]((https://wiki.techsaviours.org/). This finally gives you access to your services from anywhere. 
It also means that the wiki or your digital privacy have a good base to start with. There will always be something, more or maybe even less for you. Other operating systems or just other services/apps that others or you prefer instead. And that's fine, we all even have options to choose from and don't have to rely only on Microsoft & Co.

Regardless of which tutorial(s) you prefer, here is yet another tutorial of WireGuard and a quick overview of how to import your [Phone](https://wiki.techsaviours.org/en/phone/apps/wireguard) and [Desktop](https://wiki.techsaviours.org/en/desktop/services/wireguard) devices.

The next tutorial will be KeePassXC for desktop and a bunch of Linux Mobile tutorials.


# Extras

Tomorrow or so another "Extras" will also be published. This will make the wiki even more complete ;)


Have a good weekend!
