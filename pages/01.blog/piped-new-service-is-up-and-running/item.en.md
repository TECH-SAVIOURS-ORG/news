We have added a new service to our [service section](https://techsaviours.org/#freeservices) called piped.
Which is another privacy-friendly client for YouTube like Individous, Newpipe ...

You can use the add-on [privacy redirects](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-redirect/) for Firefox or [pipes 
redirect addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/piped-redirects/).

There is also [an app](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped#made-with-piped) for iOS and Android (WIP).

We have disabled the registrations for now. We hope that local storage on your device will be part of the clients in the near future.
However, it seems that the idea is to keep the clients free of it to save resources for the server. Check [that](https://github.com/libre-tube/LibreTube/issues/128).
