Nextcloud for our wiki is basically ready since January/February but since `php-legacy` came in along we've decided to leave all the hassle for you and for us until Nextcloud supports PHP 8.2 which it does with version 26. 

Arch tested the new version in their `Community-Testing` repo and released it yesterday or so. So time to add it to our wiki with all major changes to get the new version running on your Arch Linux system.

Have fun with that
