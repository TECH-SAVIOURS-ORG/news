Our primary goal is to migrate bugs.archlinux.org to GitLab, focusing on 
packaging bugs and our internal projects. In this email, we'll outline 
the workflow for packaging bugs and seek your assistance in testing the 
migration and the bug bot in the [test migration 
group](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/groups/flyspray-migration/packaging/packages/-/...).

Please pay attention to the relevant paragraphs and everyone is strongly 
encouraged to conduct testing as outlined in the testing section.
