The next server update ("Wednesday around 5pm NZ time (8am UTC)") includes a few hours of downtime.
The reason is not really the major update of PostgreSQL. But we take the opportunity to clean up the database at the same time (especially for Matrix).

This means that Matrix and our Git instance will be unavailable during this process.
